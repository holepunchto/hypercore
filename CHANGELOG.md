# CHANGELOG

## Current

## v9.0.0

- Ease of use update to signatures, https://github.com/mafintosh/hypercore/issues/260
- Updates Noise protocol to latest, which introduces a standard DH handshake (through simple-handshake 2.0).
- Updates sodium-native from 2 to 3 across the board. 3 uses n-api, so no more builds needed when Node is released.
